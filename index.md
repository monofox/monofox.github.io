# Its a mono fox!
OK.. he just asked me to add some descriptions. Mono is a fox but its only mono and not stereo. Thats why its this name. So mostly thats all. Just continue. Don't look too long here. 
I might add some Lorem Ipsum if i would like. But to be honest, i don't want. Too much work. Its easy.
